# dg-flo
Discontinuous Galerkin code to solve flow equations
Adrien Crovato, 2020

## Features
dg-flo can solve the:
- [ ] Burger's equation on a one-dimensional mesh
- [ ] Euler's equation on one and two-dimension meshes

## Requirements
dg-flo needs
- python 3 interpreter and libraries
- numpy package
- matplotlib package (optional)

## Usage
Test cases are given under the directory [tests](tests/). Run the computation by calling `run.py path/to/your_script.py`. Output files will be saved in your current working directory under a `workspace` directory.
